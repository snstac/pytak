## PyTAK 7.1.0-beta

- Removed `bytes` as a data type option for `lat`, `lon`, `ce`, `hae`, `le` in `gen_cot_xml(...) function`.
  - Bytes was not building well in XML, preferred str, float, or int.
- Modified `gen_cot(...)` function to reflect removal of `bytes` data type.
- Added function `gen_cot_detailed_xml(...)` to facilitate building a COT with all attributes for the `event` element, and some `detail` elements.
- Added function `gen_delete_cot_xml(uid)` that will delete any previous COT that matches the `uid` that needs to be deleted.
  - Just provide the `uid` as argument.
- Added function `is_valid_datetime()` to validate a datetime string that needs to match the following formats: `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ` with millis or `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` without millis.
- Added constant: DEFAULT_COT_DELETE_TYPE: str = "t-x-d-d".
- Added an Enum class for the `access` attribute for `event` element.
  - Class is called: `MIL_STD_6090_ACCESS_VALUES`
- Added two more example scripts:
  - `cot_builder.py` -> to show the use of built-in functions that facilitate building a COT.
  - `cot_deleter.py` -> to show how to delete a COT after sending it.

## PyTAK 6.2.1

- Add 'PEM pass phrase' prompt instructions. Fixes #54.

## PyTAK 6.1.0

- Fixes #43: Add broadcast UDP support.
- Fixes #46: Move documentation from Sphinx to Markdown.
- Fixed #47: Change default constants to match config type hints (e.g. str instead of int).
- Updated Type Hints for function & method parameters.
- Updated Coverage for Python version work-arounds.
- Refactored `udp_client()` function, API unchanged.

- Renamed `cs2url()` to `connectString2url()`.

## PyTAK 6.0.0

- Moved & expanded documentation at https://pytak.readthedocs.io/
- `COT_URL` now defaults to `udp+wo://239.2.3.1:6969`, aka 'Mesh SA' in ATAK & WinTAK. This disables receiveing CoT by default. To enable receiving CoT, remove the `+wo` modifier.

* Fixes #31: 'protobuf support', "TAK Protocol, Version 1" is now the default output from PyTAK, _BUT_ you must install the `takproto` python module seperately to ENABLE, otherwise reverts to CoT XML. PyTAK will automatically detect if the `COT_URL` is multicast or unicast, and use the appropriate protobuf format. See: https://github.com/snstac/takproto
* Fixes #36: 'Network is unreachable', added `PYTAK_MULTICAST_LOCAL_ADDR` to allow setting bind port on network connections.
* Fixes #37: 'unknown compression', reverted to github builder ubuntu-20.04
