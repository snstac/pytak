    Representation of a Datagram socket attached via either bind() or

    Due to the stateless nature of datagram protocols, errors are not
    immediately available to this class at the point an action was performed
    that will generate it.  Rather, successive calls will raise exceptions if
    there are any.  Checking for exceptions can be done explicitly by using the
    exception property.

    For instance, failure to connect to a remote endpoint will not be noticed
    until some point in time later, at which point ConnectionRefused will be
    raised.
